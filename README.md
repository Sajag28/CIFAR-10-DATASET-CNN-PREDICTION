# CIFAR-10-DATASET-CNN-PREDICTION
This project demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow. Its objective is to achieve high accuracy in differentiating and classifying the 10 object categories within the dataset.

Key Features:

Leverages TensorFlow, a leading deep learning framework, for building and training the CNN.
Utilizes a CNN architecture optimized for image data, extracting relevant features using convolutions and pooling layers.
Trains the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing, representing 10 diverse object classes (airplane, automobile, bird, etc.).
